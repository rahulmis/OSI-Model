# Simple Report On OSI(Open System Interconnection) Model



### *Basicallly the osi model is use to define, How the data is transfer from 1 computer to another.*

## There are 7 layers in OSI model.

1. ### Applictaion Layer
2. ### Presentation Layer
3. ### Session Layer
4. ### Transport Layer
5. ### Network Layer
6. ### Data Link Layer
7. ### Physical Layer





# 1 Applictaion Layer :
* Application layer provide services for network applictaion with the help of protocols to perform user activities.
* For file transfer(FTP)
* For Web Surfing Http/Https
* For emails(SMTP)
* For Virtual Terminals(Telnet)
  

# 2 Presentation Layer : 
* It recieves data from Applictaion Layer
* This data in the form of character and numbers.

# 3 Session Layer : 
* Session layer helps setting up Network Authentication and Authorization.

# 4 Transport Layer : 
* Transport layer controls the reliability of communication through
* * Segmentation
* * Flow Control
* * Error Control
  
# 5 Network Layer : 
* Network layer works for the transmission of data from one host to the other located in different networks. 
  
# 6 Data Link Layer : 
* The data link layer is responsible for the node to node delivery of the message. 

# 7 Physical Layer :
